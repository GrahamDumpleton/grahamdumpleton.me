  "title": "Maintaining decorator state using a class.",
  "content": "This is the sixth post in my series of blog posts about Python decorators and how I believe they are generally poorly implemented. It follows on from the previous post titled '[Decorators which accept arguments](http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2014/01/decorators-which-accept-arguments.html)', with the very first post in the series being '[How you implemented your Python decorator is wrong](http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2014/01/how-you-implemented-your-python.html)'.\n\n  \nIn the previous post I described how to implement decorators which accept arguments. This covered mandatory arguments, but also how to have a decorator optionally accept arguments. I also touched on how one can maintain state between invocations of the decorator wrapper function for a specific wrapped function.  \n  \nOne of the approaches described for maintaining state was to implement the decorator as a class. Using this approach though resulted in an unexpected error.  \n  \nThis post will explore the source of the error when attempting to implement our decorator as a class using our new decorator factory and function wrapper, and then see if any other issues crop up.  \n  \n\n\n###  Single decorator for functions and methods\n\n  \nAs described in the previous post, the pattern we were trying to use so as to allow us to use a class as a decorator was:  \n\n\n> class with\\_arguments\\(object\\):  \n>  def \\_\\_init\\_\\_\\(self, arg\\):  \n>  self.arg = arg\n\n> @decorator  \n>  def \\_\\_call\\_\\_\\(self, wrapped, instance, args, kwargs\\):  \n>  return wrapped\\(\\*args, \\*\\*kwargs\\) \n\n> @with\\_arguments\\(arg=1\\)  \n>  def function\\(\\):  \n>  pass\n\nThe intent here is that the application of the decorator, with arguments supplied, would result in an instance of the class being created. In the next phase where that is called with the wrapped function, the \\_\\_call\\_\\_\\(\\) method with @decorator applied will be used as a decorator on the function to be wrapped. The end result should be that the \\_\\_call\\_\\_\\(\\) method of the class instance created ends up being our wrapper function.  \n  \nWhen the decorated function is now called, the \\_\\_call\\_\\_\\(\\) method of the class would be called with it in turn calling the wrapped function. As the \\_\\_call\\_\\_\\(\\) method at that point is bound to an instance of the class, it would have access to the state that it contained.  \n  \nWhen we tried this though we got, at the time that the decorator was being applied, the error:  \n\n\n> Traceback \\(most recent call last\\):  \n>  File \"test.py\", line 483, in <module>  \n>  @with\\_arguments\\(1\\)  \n>  TypeError: \\_decorator\\(\\) takes exactly 1 argument \\(2 given\\)\n\nThe \\_decorator\\(\\) function in this case is the inner function from our decorator factory.  \n\n\n> def decorator\\(wrapper\\):  \n>  @functools.wraps\\(wrapper\\)  \n>  def \\_decorator\\(wrapped\\):  \n>  return function\\_wrapper\\(wrapped, wrapper\\)  \n>  return \\_decorator\n\nThe mistake that has been made here is that we are using a function closure to implement our decorator factory, yet we were expecting it to work on both normal functions and methods of classes.  \n  \nThe reason this will not work is due to the binding that occurs when a method of a class is accessed. This process was described in a previous post in this series and is the result of the descriptor protocol being applied. This binding results in the reference to the instance of the class being automatically passed as the first argument to the method.  \n  \nNow as the \\_decorator\\(\\) function was acting as a wrapper for the method call, and because \\_decorator\\(\\) was not defined so as to accept both 'self' and 'wrapped' as arguments, the call would fail.  \n  \nWe could create a special variant of the decorator factory to be used just on instance methods, but that goes against the specific complaint expressed earlier in regard to how people create multiple variants of decorators for use on normal functions and instance methods.  \n  \nTo resolve this issue, what we can do is use our function wrapper for the decorator returned by the decorator factory, instead of a function closure.  \n\n\n> def decorator\\(wrapper\\):  \n>  def \\_wrapper\\(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs\\):  \n>  def \\_execute\\(wrapped\\):  \n>  return function\\_wrapper\\(wrapped, wrapper\\)  \n>  return \\_execute\\(\\*args, \\*\\*kwargs\\)  \n>  return function\\_wrapper\\(wrapper, \\_wrapper\\)\n\n  \n\n\n###  Explicit binding of methods required\n\n  \nThis above change now means we do not have to worry about whether @decorator is being applied to a normal function, instance method or even a class method. This is because in all cases, any reference to the instance being bound to is never passed through in 'args'. Thus any wrapper function doesn't need to worry about the distinction.  \n  \nTrying again with this change though, we are confronted with a further problem. This time at the point that the wrapped function is called.  \n\n\n> >>> function\\(\\)  \n>  Traceback \\(most recent call last\\):  \n>  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>  \n>  File \"test.py\", line 243, in \\_\\_call\\_\\_  \n>  return self.wrapper\\(self.wrapped, None, args, kwargs\\)  \n>  TypeError: \\_\\_call\\_\\_\\(\\) takes exactly 5 arguments \\(4 given\\)\n\nThe issue this time is that when @decorator is applied to the \\_\\_call\\_\\_\\(\\) method, the reference it is passed is that of the unbound method. This is because this occurs during the processing of the class definition, long before any instance of the class has been created.  \n  \nNormally the reference to the instance would be supplied later when the method is bound, but because our decorator is actually a factory there are two layers involved. The target instance is available to the upper factory as the 'instance' argument, but that isn't being used in any way when the inner function wrapper object is being created which associates the function to be wrapped with our wrapper function.  \n  \nTo solve this problem we need for the case where we are being bound to an instance, to explicitly bind the wrapper function ourselves against the instance.  \n\n\n> def decorator\\(wrapper\\):  \n>  def \\_wrapper\\(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs\\):  \n>  def \\_execute\\(wrapped\\):  \n>  if instance is None:  \n>  return function\\_wrapper\\(wrapped, wrapper\\)  \n>  elif inspect.isclass\\(instance\\):  \n>  return function\\_wrapper\\(wrapped, wrapper.\\_\\_get\\_\\_\\(None, instance\\)\\)  \n>  else:  \n>  return function\\_wrapper\\(wrapped, wrapper.\\_\\_get\\_\\_\\(instance, type\\(instance\\)\\)\\)  \n>  return \\_execute\\(\\*args, \\*\\*kwargs\\)  \n>  return function\\_wrapper\\(wrapper, \\_wrapper\\)\n\nSo what we are using here is the feature of our function wrapper that allows us to implement a universal decorator. That is, one which can change its behaviour dependent upon the context it is used in.  \n  \nIn this case we had three cases we needed to deal with.  \n  \nThe first is where the instance was None. This corresponds to a normal function, a static method or where the decorator was applied to a class type.  \n  \nThe second is where the instance was not None, but where it referred to a class type. This corresponds to a class method. In this case we need to bind the wrapper function to the class type by calling the \\_\\_get\\_\\_\\(\\) method of the wrapper function explicitly.  \n  \nThe third and final case is where the instance was not None, but where it was not referring to a class type. This corresponds to an instance method. In this case we again need to bind the wrapper function, this time to the instance.  \n  \nWith these changes, we are now all done with addressing this issue, and to a large degree with filling out our new decorator pattern.  \n  \n\n\n###  Do not try and reproduce this\n\n  \nSo the complete solution we now have at this point is:  \n\n\n> class object\\_proxy\\(object\\): \n\n> def \\_\\_init\\_\\_\\(self, wrapped\\):  \n>  self.wrapped = wrapped  \n>  try:  \n>  self.\\_\\_name\\_\\_ = wrapped.\\_\\_name\\_\\_  \n>  except AttributeError:  \n>  pass \n\n> @property  \n>  def \\_\\_class\\_\\_\\(self\\):  \n>  return self.wrapped.\\_\\_class\\_\\_ \n\n> def \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_\\(self, name\\):  \n>  return getattr\\(self.wrapped, name\\) \n\n> class bound\\_function\\_wrapper\\(object\\_proxy\\): \n\n> def \\_\\_init\\_\\_\\(self, wrapped, instance, wrapper, binding, parent\\):  \n>  super\\(bound\\_function\\_wrapper, self\\).\\_\\_init\\_\\_\\(wrapped\\)  \n>  self.instance = instance  \n>  self.wrapper = wrapper  \n>  self.binding = binding  \n>  self.parent = parent \n\n> def \\_\\_call\\_\\_\\(self, \\*args, \\*\\*kwargs\\):  \n>  if self.binding == 'function':  \n>  if self.instance is None:  \n>  instance, args = args\\[0\\], args\\[1:\\]  \n>  wrapped = functools.partial\\(self.wrapped, instance\\)  \n>  return self.wrapper\\(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs\\)  \n>  else:  \n>  return self.wrapper\\(self.wrapped, self.instance, args, kwargs\\)  \n>  else:  \n>  instance = getattr\\(self.wrapped, '\\_\\_self\\_\\_', None\\)  \n>  return self.wrapper\\(self.wrapped, instance, args, kwargs\\) \n\n> def \\_\\_get\\_\\_\\(self, instance, owner\\):  \n>  if self.instance is None and self.binding == 'function':  \n>  descriptor = self.parent.wrapped.\\_\\_get\\_\\_\\(instance, owner\\)  \n>  return bound\\_function\\_wrapper\\(descriptor, instance, self.wrapper,  \n>  self.binding, self.parent\\)  \n>  return self \n\n> class function\\_wrapper\\(object\\_proxy\\): \n\n> def \\_\\_init\\_\\_\\(self, wrapped, wrapper\\):  \n>  super\\(function\\_wrapper, self\\).\\_\\_init\\_\\_\\(wrapped\\)  \n>  self.wrapper = wrapper  \n>  if isinstance\\(wrapped, classmethod\\):  \n>  self.binding = 'classmethod'  \n>  elif isinstance\\(wrapped, staticmethod\\):  \n>  self.binding = 'staticmethod'  \n>  else:  \n>  self.binding = 'function' \n\n> def \\_\\_get\\_\\_\\(self, instance, owner\\):  \n>  wrapped = self.wrapped.\\_\\_get\\_\\_\\(instance, owner\\)  \n>  return bound\\_function\\_wrapper\\(wrapped, instance, self.wrapper,  \n>  self.binding, self\\) \n\n> def \\_\\_call\\_\\_\\(self, \\*args, \\*\\*kwargs\\):  \n>  return self.wrapper\\(self.wrapped, None, args, kwargs\\) \n\n> def decorator\\(wrapper\\):  \n>  def \\_wrapper\\(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs\\):  \n>  def \\_execute\\(wrapped\\):  \n>  if instance is None:  \n>  return function\\_wrapper\\(wrapped, wrapper\\)  \n>  elif inspect.isclass\\(instance\\):  \n>  return function\\_wrapper\\(wrapped, wrapper.\\_\\_get\\_\\_\\(None, instance\\)\\)  \n>  else:  \n>  return function\\_wrapper\\(wrapped, wrapper.\\_\\_get\\_\\_\\(instance, type\\(instance\\)\\)\\)  \n>  return \\_execute\\(\\*args, \\*\\*kwargs\\)  \n>  return function\\_wrapper\\(wrapper, \\_wrapper\\)\n\nTake heed though of what was said in prior posts though. The object proxy implementation given here is not a complete solution. As a result, do not take this code and try and use it yourself as is. If you do you will find that some aspects of performing introspection on the wrapped function will not work as indicated they should.  \n  \nIn particular, access to the function \\_\\_doc\\_\\_ string will always yield None. Various attributes such as \\_\\_qualname\\_\\_ in Python 3 and \\_\\_module\\_\\_ are not propagated either.  \n  \nHandling an attribute such as \\_\\_doc\\_\\_ string correctly is actually a bit of a pain. This is because you cannot use a \\_\\_doc\\_\\_ property in an object proxy base class that returns the value from the wrapped function and have it then work when you derive another class from it. This is because the separate \\_\\_doc\\_\\_ string attribute from the derived class, even if no documentation string were specified in the derived class, will override that of the base class.  \n  \nSo the object proxy as shown here was intended to be illustrative only of what was required.  \n  \nIn some respects all the code here is meant to be illustrative only. It is not here to say use this code but to show you the general path to implementing a more robust decorator implementation. It is to provide a narrative from which you can learn. If you were expecting a one line TLDR summary on how to do it, then you can forget it, things just aren't that simple.  \n  \n\n\n###  Introducing the wrapt decorator module\n\n  \nIf I am telling you not to use this code, what are you supposed to do then?  \n  \nThe answer to that already exists in the form of the [wrapt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wrapt) module on PyPi.  \n  \nThe wrapt package has been available for a number of months already, but isn't widely known of at this point. It implements all of what is described but also more. The module has a complete implementation of the object proxy required to make all this work correctly. The module also provides a range of other features related to the decorator factory as well as other separate features related to monkey patching in general.  \n  \nAlthough I am now finally pointing out that this module exists, I will not be stopping the blog posts at this point as there is a range of topics I still want to cover. These include examples of how a universal decorator can be used, enabling/disabling of decorators, performance issues, the remaining parts of the implementation of the object proxy, monkey patching and much more.  \n  \nIn the next post in this series I will look at one specific example of using a universal decorator by posing the question of if Python decorators are so wonderful, why does Python not provide a @synchronized decorator?  \n  \nSuch a decorator was held up as a bit of a poster child as to what could be done with decorators when they were first introduced to the language, yet all the implementations I could find are half baked and not very practical in the real world. I believe that a universal decorator can help here and we can actually have a usable @synchronized decorator. I will therefore explore that possibility in the next post.",
