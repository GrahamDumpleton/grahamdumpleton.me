Version 1.0 of mod\_wsgi is now available and can be downloaded from <http://www.modwsgi.org>. The package is regarded as being quite stable and therefore suitable for use in production environments.  
  
For those not familiar with mod\_wsgi, the aim in developing it is to implement a simple to use [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) module which can host any [Python](http://www.python.org/) application which supports the Python [WSGI](http://www.wsgi.org/) interface. In addition, the module should be suitable for use in hosting high performance production web sites, as well as your average personal sites running on commodity web hosting services.  
  
This initial version of mod\_wsgi is suitable for use on dedicated systems or virtual private servers. With suitable configuration it could also be used by web hosting companies specialising in providing hosting for Python web applications.  
  
With a bit more work and encouragement, future versions of mod\_wsgi will include additional features which should help it to also break into the truly low cost commodity web hosting market where Python is currently sadly lacking as an option. So, stay tuned for more updates.

Could you expand a bit more on what's the "suitable configuration" for virtual hosting? :-\)

Well, after reading more. I found that the question is already answered in length in other posts. Thanks\!
