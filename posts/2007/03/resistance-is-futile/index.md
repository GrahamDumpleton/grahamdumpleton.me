I have finally given in and let myself be absorbed into the Google consciousness by getting a gmail and blogger account. I have held out from doing this for a very long time, but as they say, 'resistance is futile'. About the only thing I probably still need is a Google version of a wiki to replace MoinMoin and the mind meld will be complete. I guess I will have to wait though to see what comes out of Google's acquisition of [JotSpot](http://www.jotspot.com/).  
  
My intention with the blog is to use it to post about technical topics. In the main this will be about such areas as [Python](http://www.python.org/), [WSGI](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/) and [mod\_python](http://www.modpython.org/), as well as my work on personal projects such as [mod\_wsgi](http://www.modwsgi.org/), [OSE](http://www.dscpl.com.au/wiki/OSE) and [makeit](http://www.dscpl.com.au/wiki/Makeit). Hopefully the ability to easily post up small bits of information at a time will not just be another excuse to get the real documentation on my own projects finished. :-\)
