Am now onto the third release candidate for version 1.0 of [mod\_wsgi](http://www.modwsgi.org/). If no more problems come up before this weekend is out, I will release the final version 1.0 on Sunday, or shortly thereafter. So, this is the last chance to give it a go and provide feedback on any problems. Many thanks to all who have given feedback so far.
