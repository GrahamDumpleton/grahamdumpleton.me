  "content": "UPDATE: Video now available at <http://blip.tv/file/3840484>.\n\n  \n\n\n[Sydney PyCon](http://au.pycon.org/) is over and my talk on [mod\\_wsgi](http://www.modwsgi.org/) went okay. For those interested the slides can be downloaded from the mod\\_wsgi [site](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/downloads/list).\n\n  \n\n\nRather than try and explain how mod\\_wsgi worked, I concentrated on showing how to setup some basic things, but in doing so deliberately hit all the common problems that some people have with setting up a WSGI application under Apache and mod\\_wsgi. The slides therefore capture the details of various obscure error messages one will find in the Apache error logs when things do go wrong.\n\n  \n\n\nTo illustrate issues related to the Python module search path and virtual environments I used Django as an example. The slides therefore are especially valuable if you are trying to deploy Django using mod\\_wsgi.",

The only unknown to me was the location as is outside of the main centres. As such saw it as being a bit hard to get to. It would be good if the travel and accommodation parts of the NZ PyCon site could be updated sooner rather than later so a prospective presenter from outside of NZ can appreciate how much trouble or otherwise it may be.",
