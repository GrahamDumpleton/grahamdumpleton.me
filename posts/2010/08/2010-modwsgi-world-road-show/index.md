FYI. I will be travelling to US, Canada and Malaysia for a holiday from late September. If any Python user group or company is interested in hosting a mod\_wsgi talk while I am there, drop me an email at Graham.Dumpleton at Gmail. Cities where I will possibly have the time available are Los Angeles \(??\), New York and San Francisco in the US. Toronto in Canada and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The trip is primarily a family holiday so specific days I may have available will be limited, but we might be able to organise something if there is enough interest and people can help me get to where ever any talk may be held so I don't get lost.

If you pass by Montréal, we'd love to have you give a talk at Montréal-Python.

It is only the cities I mentioned. Only other place I will be staying for a while is Orlando, but going to be too busy there.

Hi Graham, I'm Soares and I met you in PyCon Singapore this June. I stay in Malaysia, so maybe I can help you ask the local Malaysia Python group and see if anyone is interested? :\)

BayPIGgies in the San Francisco bay area is interested in setting up one or two places \(one in silicon valley, the other in San Francisco proper\) for you to talk \(the Python community has been growing leaps and bounds around here\).

@Jim. Likely can only be one event in SF and will have to be a specific Friday night I am there. Turns out only there two nights, plus one night waiting for flight at 1am in the morning. Thought I was there longer, but not so. Am still a bit foggy on the dates as my better half organised it all.  
  
@crf. Malaysia is the easiest one as there a whole week and go there a lot. Thus know my way around. Also know some one who goes there to work a lot and they can probably also get me in contact with people. Still mention it to them to see if they are interested. I'll be staying near Cheras.

Let me try it,might just have a talk in our local hackerspace in KL actually in PJ  
  
but i try to find our usual spot, near KLCC, which is more convinient for everyone

Note that I am not in Malaysia until around second week in October, not September as someone has said on python.my list.

### Unknown - August 31, 2010 at 2:11 AM

Thanks for the reply. Let me know which Friday and I'll see about getting a place and advertising it.   
  
I'm assuming San Francisco city proper. If you plan for that Friday evening to be in the east bay \(Berkeley or Oakland\) or the south bay \(Silicon Valley--Santa Clara, Mountain View...\) or other SF bay environs, let me know that.   
  
Many thanks\!

If you can swing up to Boston while you're in NYC \(4 hr bus or train ride\), we'd love to have you speak at the Boston Python meetup. http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/

### Graham Dumpleton - September 20, 2010 at 1:41 PM

@Nate. Sorry, Boston a bit out of the way this time round.  
  
Looks like I will be doing one talk in San Francisco and that is it.
