  "title": "Requests running in wrong Django instance under Apache/mod_wsgi.",
  "content": "Configuring [Apache/mod\\_wsgi](http://www.modwsgi.org/) to host multiple Django instances has always been a bit tricky for some. In practice though it should be quite straight forward. For a single Django instance mounted at the root of the web site, the WSGIScriptAlias line would be something like:  \n  \nWSGIScriptAlias / /some/path/project-1/wsgi.py  \n  \nIf wanting to host a second Django instance under the same host name but at a sub URL, you would use:  \n  \nWSGIScriptAlias /suburl /some/path/project-2/wsgi.py  \nWSGIScriptAlias / /some/path/project-1/wsgi.py  \n  \nIf the Django instances are not under the same host, then it would instead simply be a matter of adding them to the respective VirtualHost.  \n  \n<VirtualHost \\*:80>  \nServerName site-1.example.com  \nWSGIScriptAlias /some/path/project-1/wsgi.py  \n...  \n</VirtualHost>  \n  \n<VirtualHost \\*:80>  \nServerName site-2.example.com  \nWSGIScriptAlias /some/path/project-2/wsgi.py  \n...  \n</VirtualHost>  \n  \nIn both cases, whether under the same host name or different ones, both Django instances would run in the same process. Separation would be maintained however by virtue of mod\\_wsgi running each WSGI application mounted using WSGIScriptAlias in a distinct Python sub interpreter within the processes they are running in.  \n  \nThe directive which controls which named Python sub interpreter within the process is used is WSGIApplicationGroup. The default for this directive is %\\{RESOURCE\\}.  \n  \nFor this default value of %\\{RESOURCE\\}the sub interpreter name will be constructed from the host name \\(as specified by the ServerName directive\\), the port \\(if not port 80/443\\) and the value of the WSGI environment variable SCRIPT\\_NAME as deduced from the URL mount point set by the WSGIScriptAlias directive.  \n  \nSo in the first instance above where both Django instances run under the same host name, the distinct named sub interpreters within the process would be called:  \n  \nsite-1.example.com:/  \nsite-1.example.com:/suburl  \n  \nIn the second instance where they run under separate host names they would be:  \n  \nsite-1.example.com:/  \nsite-2.example.com:/  \n  \nSo as long as you don't fiddle with which sub interpreter is used by specifying the WSGIApplicationGroup directive, mod\\_wsgi should maintain separation between the multiple Django instances.  \n  \nWhat therefore can go wrong and why would requests get routed to the wrong Django instance?  \n  \n\n\n####  Ordering of WSGIScriptAlias directives.\n\n  \n\n\nThe first scenario where one may see requests being handled by the wrong Django instance is where the multiple Django instances are running under the same host name and the ordering of the WSGIScriptAlias directives is wrong.\n\n  \n\n\nWhen using the WSGIScriptAlias multiple times under the same host name, it is important that the WSGIScriptAlias for sub URLs comes first.\n\n  \n\n\nIn other words, the ordering is such that the most deeply nested URLs must come first. If you don't do that, then the shorter URL will match first and take precedence, thereby swallowing up all requests for both Django instances.\n\n  \n\n\nFor example, if the directives above were instead written as:\n\n  \n\n\nWSGIScriptAlias / /some/path/project-1/wsgi.py\n\nWSGIScriptAlias /suburl /some/path/project-2/wsgi.py\n\n  \n\n\nall requests would get routed into the first Django instance, even those for '/suburl', as the shorter URL of '/' specified with the first WSGIScriptAlias directive would always match, even before attempting to match against '/suburl'.  \n  \nThe solution if this is the cause is obviously to reorder the WSGIScriptAlias directives as appropriate to ensure the longest URLs come first.  \n  \n\n\n####  Leaking of process environment variables.\n\n  \nIn order to specify the module that the Django applications settings are contained in, it is necessary to set the process environment variable DJANGO\\_SETTINGS\\_MODULE.  \n  \nimport os  \nos.environ\\['DJANGO\\_SETTINGS\\_MODULE'\\] = 'mysite.settings'  \n  \nimport django.core.handlers.wsgi  \napplication = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler\\(\\)  \n  \n  \nWhen using Apache/mod\\_wsgi, this is done in the WSGI script file and the environment variable would be set in os.environ when the WSGI script file is loaded.  \n  \nAs much as process environment variables and global variables have their limitations and are arguably a bad idea for specifying configuration, this has still worked okay until recently.  \n  \nProblems started when Django 1.4 was released however. In Django 1.4 the content of the WSGI script file was changed from what was described previously for Django 1.3 and older versions to:  \n  \nimport os  \nos.environ.setdefault\\('DJANGO\\_SETTINGS\\_MODULE', 'mysite.settings'\\)  \n  \nfrom django.core.wsgi import get\\_wsgi\\_application  \napplication = get\\_wsgi\\_application\\(\\)  \n  \n  \nAlthough the differences on first glance appear to be fine, they aren't and the WSGI script file in Django 1.4 will break Apache/mod\\_wsgi for hosting multiple Django instances in the same process.  \n  \nThe key problem is what the setdefault\\(\\) method does when setting the environment variable DJANGO\\_SETTINGS\\_MODULE compared to using assignment as previously. In the case of assignment the environment variable is always updated. For setdefault\\(\\), it is only updated if it is not already set.  \n  \nYou might ask why would this be a problem. It is a problem because although os.environ looks like a normal dictionary, it isn't. Instead it is actually a custom class which only looks like a dictionary. When a key/value is set in os.environ, it is also setting it at the C level by calling putenv\\(\\).  \n  \nWhat now happens with our multiple Django instances running in the same process is that for the first one to be loaded, DJANGO\\_SETTINGS\\_MODULE will not be set and so setdefault\\(\\) will actually set it, including it being set globally to the process. When the second Django instance is loaded, at the point the sub interpreter is created, os.environ is populated from the C level environ, thereby picking up the value of DJANGO\\_SETTINGS\\_MODULE set when the first Django instance was loaded. In this case setdefault\\(\\) will not override the value as it already sees it as being set.  \n  \nTechnically this leakage of environment variables between Python sub interpreters within the one process would always happen, but use of setdefault\\(\\) instead of assignment means DJANGO\\_SETTINGS\\_MODULE will not get overridden to be the correct value for the second Django instance to be loaded.  \n  \nThe end result of the leakage can be one of two things. If the name of the Django settings module used for the first Django instance doesn't exist in the context of the second Django instance, then an import failure will occur and the Django instance will fail to be initialised. In this first case an actual failure will occur with nothing working and so it will be fairly obvious.  \n  \nA more problematic case though is where you are using one code base and multiple Django settings modules for each of the distinct Django instances being run. In this case the Django settings module may well be found, with the result being that when attempting to load up the second Django instance, a duplicate of the first instance would be loaded instead. Where URLs are now meant to be routed to the second instance, they would instead be handled as if being sent to the first instance as the configuration for the first is still being used.  \n  \nThere are two solutions if this is the cause. The quickest is to replace the use of setdefault\\(\\) to set the environment variable in the WSGI script file with more usual assignment.  \n  \nos.environ\\['DJANGO\\_SETTINGS\\_MODULE'\\] = 'mysite.settings'  \n  \nAn alternative which involves a bit more work, but can have other benefits, is to switch to using daemon mode of mod\\_wsgi to run the Django instances and delegate each to a separate set of processes. By running the Django instances in separate processes there can be no possibility of environment variables leaking from one to the other.  \n  \nWSGIDaemonProcess project-2  \nWSGIScriptAlias /suburl /some/path/project-2/wsgi.py process-group=project-2  \n\n\n  \n\n\nWSGIDaemonProcess project-1\n\nWSGIScriptAlias / /some/path/project-1/wsgi.py process-group=project-1\n\n  \n\n\n####  Fallback to default VirtualHost definition.\n\n  \n\n\nApache supports hosting of sites under multiple host names by way of name based virtual hosts. These are setup with the VirtualHost directive as previously shown.\n\n  \n\n\n<VirtualHost \\*:80>\n\nServerName site-1.example.com\n\nServerAlias www.site-1.example.com\n\nWSGIScriptAlias /some/path/project-1/wsgi.py\n\n...\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\n  \n\n\n<VirtualHost \\*:80>\n\nServerName site-2.example.com\n\nWSGIScriptAlias /some/path/project-2/wsgi.py\n\n...\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\n  \n\n\nThe ServerName directive specified within the VirtualHost gives the primary host name by which the site is identified. If the same site can be accessed by other names, the ServerAlias directive can be used to list them explicitly, or by using a wildcard pattern.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat is not obvious however is if there are any host names by which the server IP is addressable and they are not covered by a ServerName or ServerAlias directive, rather than Apache giving an error, it will route the request to the first VirtualHost definition it found when it read its configuration.\n\n  \n\n\nIn the above example, if the host name 'www.site-2.example.com' also existed and mapped to the server IP, because that host name wasn't covered by a ServerAlias directive for the second VirtualHost, the request would actually end up being handled by the Django instance running 'site-1.example.com'.\n\n  \n\n\nTo address this problem you simply need to be diligent in ensuring that you have correctly mapped all host names you wish to have directed at a site. Using mod\\_wsgi daemon mode will make absolutely no difference in this situation as it is Apache that is routing the request to the wrong VirtualHost before the request even gets passed off to mod\\_wsgi.\n\n  \n\n\nAs a failsafe to pick up such issues and ensure that requests don't unintentionally go to the wrong site, a good practice may be to ensure that the first VirtualHost that Apache encounters when reading its configuration is actually a dummy definition which doesn't equate to an actual site.\n\n  \n\n\n<VirtualHost \\_default\\_:\\*>\n\nDeny from all\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\n  \n\n\nThis could then be setup to fail all requests by way of forbidding access. A custom error document could also be used to customise the error response if necessary.",

      "content": "@hdante The use of assignment is not a race condition for the documented example given in the blog post because it is done at global scope within the WSGI script file. The WSGI script file would be loaded once and the loading is under the context of an import lock and so only one request thread can trigger the loading. There is thus no possibility for the assignment in that specific WSGI script to be done concurrently from multiple threads.  \n  \nIf however you do the assignment within the application\\(\\) function as you do on a per request basis, and which I already said you shouldn't do because that whole concept is fundamentally broken if the value can change per request, then you will have problems.  \n  \nAs I already said, use the mod\\_wsgi mailing list if you want to have a discussion about this. Using the comment section of a blog post is not the proper forum for a discussion.",
