  "title": "An awesome year for Python web hosting.",
  "content": "This year is shaping up to be an awesome year for Python web hosting. Not only do we have existing reliable providers like [WebFaction](http://www.webfaction.com/), but we now also have a gaggle of Python specific web hosting services coming online. So many that one can easily start loosing track of who they are. As such, doing this post to list those that I know of. Are there any more that people know of that are just starting up?  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe new contenders that I know of are as follows:\n\n  * [ep.io](http://www.ep.io/)\n  * [gondor.io](http://gondor.io/)\n  * [djangozoom.com](http://djangozoom.com/)\n  * [stable.io](http://stable.io/)\n  * [djangy.com](https://www.djangy.com/)\n  * [pydra.com](http://pydra.com/)\n  * [apphosted.com](https://apphosted.com/)\n\n\n\nWhat will be even more awesome will be to see these teamed up with production monitoring tools like those from [NewRelic](http://www.newrelic.com/). NewRelic has been building relationships with hosting services for other languages they already support, which provide people who sign up with that hosting service free access to their [Bronze level subscription](http://www.newrelic.com/web-app-monitoring-pricing.html). The latest of these announced was for a [PHP web hosting service](http://blog.newrelic.com/2011/01/25/php-fog-offers-free-new-relic-rpm/). So, imagine how things will be if this sort of tool becomes available for the Python web community. As I say, looking to be an awesome year for Python web hosting.\n\n  \n\n\nAnd yes, some will say this is just an unashamed blatant plug for NewRelic just because I am working there now. Seriously though, I reckon this influx of new Python web hosting services, and the monitoring tools to match, is going to be a really great thing for the Python web community. I know I have not been this excited about something for a very very long time. :-\\)",

Links advertising existing old school web hosting services, ie., those who provide servers for PHP, Python or arbitrary FASTCGI applications will not be posted. Am only interested in knowing about these new Heroku style of services which are starting to become available and which are specifically dedicated to Python and which are normally using git/mercurial push for automatic deployment to a black box infrastructure and not systems which give you shell or cPanel type access.",

      "content": "Google App Engine was not mentioned because it has been around for ages. The point of the post was to highlight the 'NEW' kids on the block. It is not meant to be a catalogue of everything that is available.  \n  \nAn important distinction with the new offerings is that they offer up conventional database systems and you aren't forced into using some special purpose database. The new systems also tend to use tools such as git/mercurial to push changes and deploy. This is the style of system am looking at.",

So it isn't necessarily the same market as the existing providers.",
