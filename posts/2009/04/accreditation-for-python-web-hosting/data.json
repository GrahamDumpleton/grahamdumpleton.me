  "title": "Accreditation For Python Web Hosting",
  "content": "I have already described the [need](http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2009/04/improving-commercial-pythonwsgi-hosting.html) for better Python web hosting. Some of the comments in that discussion make me wonder if we need some sort of accreditation for Python web hosting. After all, there is a huge difference between a web hosting company who only offers CGI and whose only goal is to maximise profit by cramming as many unsuspecting users into one machine as possible, and a web hosting company who consciously regards quality of service as being equally or more important, and as such offers a much higher quality of hosting than just CGI, with a ratio of users to machines which also benefits the users and not just themselves.\n\n  \n\n\nSo, maybe one of the things that could come out of any project to improve the quality of Python web hosting, is a checklist of what would be regarded as the minimum criteria to be regarded as a provider of quality Python web hosting services. If the Python community saw this as worthwhile, maybe the Python Software Foundation itself might want to give it its blessing. In order to get the accreditation, as well as satisfy the criteria, part of the deal could be that web hosting companies give some sort of donation back to the Python Software Foundation for the right to carry the accreditation.\n\n  \n\n\nObviously trying to run such a program could be fraught with danger and maybe accreditation should be only for some set period before being reviewed, but maybe something to think about.",
