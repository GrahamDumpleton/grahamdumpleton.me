  "content": "No problems were reported with last release candidate and no one took issue with [Python 3.X support](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/SupportForPython3X), so have finally released [mod\\_wsgi 3.0](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ChangesInVersion0300). Have also released a very minor update of 2.X branch as well in form of [mod\\_wsgi 2.7](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ChangesInVersion0207). Unless significant issues come up, there will be no more releases from the 2.X branch.",

The changes only affect building form package distribution scripts which inject CFLAGS into configure. If you have got existing versions compiled, no need to bother with update versions when they come out. If just want the patch, see mailing list discussion.",
