  "title": "WSGI and printing to standard output.",
  "content": "If you use WSGI on top of CGI, the WSGI adapter communicates with the web server using standard input \\(sys.stdin\\) and standard output \\(sys.stdout\\). Available WSGI adapters for CGI do not do anything to try and protect the original sys.stdin and sys.stdout. This means that if you use 'print' to output debug messages for your application, without redirecting 'print' to sys.stderr explicitly within your code, then you will actually screw up the response from your WSGI application.\n\n  \n\n\nAlthough CGI may not be the most popular platform to host WSGI applications, with the intent of trying to promote the cause of writing portable WSGI application code, in [mod\\_wsgi](http://www.modwsgi.org/) the decision was made to restrict access to [sys.stdin](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ApplicationIssues#Reading_From_Standard_Input) and [sys.stdout](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ApplicationIssues#Writing_To_Standard_Output) to highlight when non portable WSGI code was being written.\n\n  \n\n\nThe result of doing this is that when 'print' was used in a WSGI application hosted by mod\\_wsgi, a Python exception would be raised of the type:\n    \n    \n    IOError: sys.stdout access restricted by mod_wsgi\n\nThis was all done with good intention, but what has been found is that people can't be bothered reading the [documentation](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ApplicationIssues#Writing_To_Standard_Output) which explains why it was done and even when they do, they still can't be bothered fixing up the code not to use 'print'. It seems the convenience of using 'print' out weighs the ideal of writing code that may actually work across different WSGI hosting mechanisms.\n\n  \n\n\nMore annoying is that whenever questions arise about this error on the irc channels, rather than people being told to read the documentation and/or fix their code not to use 'print', voodoo is summoned and they are instead told to use the magic incantation of:\n    \n    \n    sys.stdout = sys.stderr\n\nYes this is given as one of the workarounds in the documentation, the other being to disable the restriction using the configuration directive specifically for the purpose, but the only reason the workaround is given is for where you have no choice because you cannot change the code to remove the 'print' statement. People aren't told this though, all they are told is to make that change and effectively ignore the whole issue.\n\n  \n\n\nThe whole mythology that is developing around this is now getting to the extent that some have been saying that neither 'sys.stdout' or 'sys.stderr' are working in mod\\_wsgi. The suggestion is starting to come out now that if you want to get any debug output from your WSGI application that you have to use a separate log file of your own creation, optionally hooked up to the 'logging' module. In one case, a [BuildOut](http://www.buildout.org/) recipe is explicitly providing an option to define the separate log file that they believe has be used to replace 'sys.stdout' and 'sys.stderr'.\n\n  \n\n\nSo, what is the real answer? Well, if you care about writing portable WSGI application code, then do not use 'print' by itself, instead redirect it to 'sys.stderr' by writing:\n    \n    \n    print >> sys.stderr, 'message ...'\n\nThis is especially important if you are writing framework libraries or plugins to be used in some other application or by other users. You shouldn't be making an assumption that 'sys.stdout' can always be used. If it is a debug or error message, then use 'sys.stderr' as it is meant to be.\n\n  \n\n\nIf for some reason you really don't want to care about the issue, then rather than use the magic voodoo above, you should simply disable the restrictions that mod\\_wsgi puts into place altogether. This is done by putting in the main Apache configuration file:\n    \n    \n    WSGIRestrictStdin Off  \n    WSGIRestrictStdout Off\n\nAnyway, because of all the contention arising over all of this, in [mod\\_wsgi 3.0](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ChangesInVersion0300) I will be giving up and will be making the restrictions off by default. If you want to write non portable WSGI application, you can quite happily do so. If you do care about portable WSGI application code, then you will be able to optionally reenable the restriction using the same directives above.",

Any WSGI framework library which used stdout for logging error messages would fail to work properly if used with a WSGI application hosted by a CGI/WSGI bridge.  \n  \nOne cant have WSGIRestrictStdin and WSGIRestrictStdout in the .htaccess file because the settings need to be known at the time that the Python interpreter is initialised. This is why they are global directives which affect the main interpreter and all sub interpreters which are created. The .htaccess file is way too late for that as the interpreters are already created before that point.",

      "content": "Jon, the documentation at 'http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/DebuggingTechniques' mentions 'wsgi.errors'. The problem is that most frameworks hide it or it is non obvious how to get access to it. Even more, practically no one realises it is there and uses it and they always just use 'print' without even redirecting it. The 'wsgi.errors' stream is also not available outside of the request context, so useless at global scope when importing modules or in background threads, or library code. Finally, using 'write\\(\\)' on 'wsgi.errors' is also technically not sufficient anyway as WSGI specification says that to guarantee display of message straight away, must also be flushed. Normally 'sys.stderr' would at least be automatic flush at end of line or earlier, except for broken systems like mod\\_python.",
