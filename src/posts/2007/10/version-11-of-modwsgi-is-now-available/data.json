  "content": "Version 1.1 of mod\\_wsgi is now available and can be downloaded from [http://www.modwsgi.org](http://www.modwsgi.org/). This is a bug fix release only and no new features are included. Two main problems addressed are possibility of processes crashing when multiple threads hit race condition on sending output via sys.stdout/sys.stderr, and conflict with the Apache mod\\_logio module which would result in mod\\_wsgi daemon processes crashing. A description of all changes in this version can be found in the [change notes](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ChangesInVersion0101). Updating to this version is recommended for all users.",
