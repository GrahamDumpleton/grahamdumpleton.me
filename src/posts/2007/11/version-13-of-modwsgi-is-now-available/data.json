  "content": "Version [1.3](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ChangesInVersion0103) of [mod\\_wsgi](http://www.modwsgi.org) is a bug fix only release, addressing issues with mod\\_wsgi daemon processes hanging under certain conditions. It is highly recommended that users of mod\\_wsgi who use daemon mode of mod\\_wsgi upgrade to this new version. A third release candidate for version [2.0](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ChangesInVersion0200) is also now being made available incorporating the same fix and adding an additional feature to detect errant Python C extension modules that don't release the Python GIL when running long, potentially blocking, operations.",
