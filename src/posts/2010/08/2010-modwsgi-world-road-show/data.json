  "content": "FYI. I will be travelling to US, Canada and Malaysia for a holiday from late September. If any Python user group or company is interested in hosting a mod\\_wsgi talk while I am there, drop me an email at Graham.Dumpleton at Gmail. Cities where I will possibly have the time available are Los Angeles \\(??\\), New York and San Francisco in the US. Toronto in Canada and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The trip is primarily a family holiday so specific days I may have available will be limited, but we might be able to organise something if there is enough interest and people can help me get to where ever any talk may be held so I don't get lost.",

Turns out only there two nights, plus one night waiting for flight at 1am in the morning. Thought I was there longer, but not so. Am still a bit foggy on the dates as my better half organised it all.  \n  \n@crf. Malaysia is the easiest one as there a whole week and go there a lot. Thus know my way around. Also know some one who goes there to work a lot and they can probably also get me in contact with people. Still mention it to them to see if they are interested. I'll be staying near Cheras.",
