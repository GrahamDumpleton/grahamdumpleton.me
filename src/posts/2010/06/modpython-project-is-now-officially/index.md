At the Apache Software Foundation June board meeting which took place on the 16th June 2010, the following resolutions were passed unanimously.

**B. Terminate the Apache Quetzalcoatl Project \(to[Attic](http://attic.apache.org/)\)**   


This was the umbrella project for [mod\_python](http://www.modpython.org) and as such mod\_python is now no more.

Long live [mod\_wsgi](http://www.modwsgi.org). Or at least until I get bored of it. ;-\)

Please be aware of previous post I made warning this was going to happen at '<[/posts/2010/05/modpython-project-soon-to-be-officially/](/posts/2010/05/modpython-project-soon-to-be-officially/)>'. This post explains some of the options you have as far as moving away from mod\_python.

It is now recorded in the Apache Attic that mod\_python has been moved there. See 'http://attic.apache.org/projects/quetzalcoatl.html'.

Hi Graham,  
  
Indeed, long live mod\_wsgi.  
  
I suggest requesting the quetzalcoatl people and asking them to link to the mod\_wsgi page.  
  
Perhaps a suitable landing page on the mod\_wsgi wiki that explains the path forward into the WSGI world?  
  
Thanks for all your good work over the years.  
  
Alan.
