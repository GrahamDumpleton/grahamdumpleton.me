The [conference schedule](http://pycon-au.org/2010/conference/schedule/) has just been announced for [PyCon in Sydney](http://pycon-au.org/2010/about/) this June. If one looks closely one will find I decided to get off my butt this time around and actually put my hand up for doing an introductory talk on [getting started with mod\_wsgi](http://pycon-au.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/55/). I usually like to hide under a rock and avoid such things, but since this is the first time PyCon is being held where I live in Sydney, thought I better put in the effort.

  


Although I am not presenting any talk, I am also going to the [PyCon in Singapore](http://apac.pycon.org/) this June as well. So, will be a busy month.

  


BTW, I will be in Singapore for a week and not just the conference days. If members of any local Python user group is interested in meeting up outside of the conference days to talk about mod\_wsgi, I could be interested. I could perhaps use you as Guinea pigs for my Sydney talk. Shopping with my family will take precedence, but can see how things go. :-\)

Also, I would be interested in listening to your mod\_wsgi talk. So, lets find a place. :\)

Wonderful talk, can't wait to rush out and implement what I learned. Can you post your slides somewhere?

### Graham Dumpleton - June 26, 2010 at 3:41 PM

Slides will likely be uploaded to mod\_wsgi site when I get home as the network here at conference sucks. :-\)

PDF of slides available at 'http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/downloads/list'.
