Prior posts on the topic of Docker and using Python with it are as follows.  
  
Please note older posts may not reflect what I now regard as best practice, or may talk about Docker images which I have superseded with new alternate images.  
  


This batch of posts looks at how to properly use Python inside of a Docker image:

  * [Installing a custom Python version into a Docker image.](/posts/2015/06/installing-custom-python-version-into/)
  * [Python virtual environments and Docker.](/posts/2016/01/python-virtual-environments-and-docker/)



This batch of posts looks at running Python web applications inside of a Docker container:

  * [Hosting Python WSGI applications using Docker.](/posts/2014/12/hosting-python-wsgi-applications-using/)
  * [Deferred build actions for Docker images.](/posts/2014/12/deferred-build-actions-for-docker-images/)

  * [Testing out deployment of Python based Opal health care framework.](/posts/2016/08/testing-out-deployment-of-python-based/)



This batch of posts was an exploration of all sorts of issues that arise in trying to run an application within Docker, using the Jupyter Notebook \(IPython\) application as an example:  


  * [Roundup of Docker issues when hosting IPython.](/posts/2016/01/roundup-of-docker-issues-when-hosting/)


  * [Running IPython as a Docker container under OpenShift.](/posts/2015/12/running-ipython-as-docker-container/)

  * [Overriding the user Docker containers run as.](/posts/2015/12/overriding-user-docker-containers-run-as/)
  * [Random user IDs when running Docker containers.](/posts/2015/12/random-user-ids-when-running-docker/)
