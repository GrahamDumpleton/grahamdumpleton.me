# Blog Project Instructions

This is the source repository for grahamdumpleton.me, a personal technical blog built with Eleventy (11ty).

## Writing Blog Content

When planning, writing or editing blog content, use the `/personal-blogging` skill which provides detailed writing style guidance, front matter conventions, and topic context.

Blog posts are standalone content — each new post covers a new topic. When creating a new post, do NOT explore or read old blog posts. The `/personal-blogging` skill already provides all the style, voice, and convention guidance needed. Only reference or cross-link previous posts if explicitly asked, such as when extending a topic from an earlier post.
